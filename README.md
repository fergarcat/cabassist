# **CABASSIT**

This app is a training exercise done for the AI Bootcamp training by [Factoría F5](https:https://factoriaf5.org/ "Factoría F5")

This is my very first python app, so please be kind on your comments.



## 📝 **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This app is meant to assist taxi drivers on their jobs, by keeping trace of their rides and calculate the total fare to be charged based up on the waiting and driving time of each ride.

To display messages and options I've made an UI using several option menus. Each menu cleans console and prints its content every time is called, waiting for a suggested input to be made. Correct input control is in use.<br>

A Ride() class is defined to store the ride information and then added to a Rides[] list, whose 3 top last records are displayed on home screen.<br>

A Timer() class is also used to measure the waiting and driving times.



## 📊 **ACHIEVED FEATURE LEVELS (From achievement goals list by F5 trainers)**

🟢 **ESSENCIAL**

Develop a CLI (Command Line Interface) in Python. A welcome message must be displayed at startup, showing the app options.

Features to be implemented:
- Start a new ride.
- Calculate fare for the time the cab is waiting (2cents/min).
- Calculate fare for the time the cab is driving (5cents/min.
- Finish a ride and show total currency amount to be charged.
- Option to start a new ride without restarting the app.
  
🟡 **MEDIUM**

- Add an option to change current fees.
